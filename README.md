I am a final-year Physics student at the Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, with a strong academic foundation in theoretical and computational physics. I have research experience in many-body quantum systems and scientific computing, and I am currently seeking opportunities for my final degree project (Spring 2026). 

My academic interests are evolving, and I am particularly drawn to the intersection of quantum mechanics and computation. I am currently exploring fields such as quantum information and quantum computing, where I hope to deepen my understanding and contribute through research.
